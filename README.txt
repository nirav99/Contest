Common Programming Problems and their Solutions

1) Permute.C - Find permutations and combinations of a given string. The string
is passed as a command line parameter.

2) PriorityQ.C - Implementation of a simple priority queue using an array. Two
operations add and delete are implemented.

3) binaryTree.C - Implementation of a typical binary tree. Methods to add data
to the tree, delete the entire tree and traversal routines (inorder, postorder
and preorder) are implemented.

4) exp.C - Algorithms to calculate x^y. The main catch in this question is to
reduce the number of multiplications. Two routines one recursive and one
iterative are implemented that perform the calculation in O(logN)
multiplications.

5) intToStr.C - Code to convert an integer to a C-style string.

6) strToInt.C - Code to convert a C-style string to an integer. The trap in this
question is to detect and suitably handle integer overflow.

7) mergeSort.C - Code for the mergesort algorithm for an array. The running
time in O(NlogN).

8) quickSort.C - Code for a simple implementation of the quick sort algorithm.
The running time is O(NlogN). 

9) kthLargest.C - Algorithm and code to find the kth largest element in an
unsorted array. This algorithm uses a variation of quicksort. The running time
is O(logN).

10) removeChars.C - Given two strings s1 and s2, remove all the characters
from s1 that are present in s2.

11) stack.C - Implementation of a stack data structure using C++ template
list.

12) rotate.C - Rotate a given string n times in linear time and constant
space. "n" can be greater than the string length.

13) maxSubseqSum.C - Find maximum subsequence sum in a series in O(n) time.
